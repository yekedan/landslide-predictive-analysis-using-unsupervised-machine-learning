# landslide-predictive-analysis-using-unsupervised-machine-learning

### Project Overview

This project aims to leverage unsupervised learning techniques to identify potential landslide-prone areas. By analyzing topographic data and clustering landslide occurrences, we seek to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that can inform effective risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

#### Methodology

Data Acquisition: Collection of landslide occurrence data and topographic information.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction from the data.
Unsupervised Learning: Application of clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Mean Shift, and Spectral Clustering.
Evaluation: Assessment of clustering results using metrics like Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.
Visualization: Creation of visualizations to interpret cluster distributions and identify patterns.
